			<p class="verseline">Here were the servants of your adversary </p>

			<p class="verseline">Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears, </p>
			<p class="verseline">He swung about his head and cut the winds, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn</p>
			<p class="verseline">While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Came more and more, and fought on part and part, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Till the Prince came, who parted either part</p>

			<p class="verseline">A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Where, underneath the grove of sycamore </p>
			<p class="verseline">That westward rooteth from the city’s side, </p>
			<p class="verseline">So early walking did I see your son</p>
			<p class="verseline">Towards him I made; but he was ware of me </p>
			<p class="verseline">And stole into the covert of the wood</p>
			<p class="verseline">I- measuring his affections by my own, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Which then most sought where most might not be found, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Being one too many by my weary self- </p>
			<p class="verseline">Pursu’d my humour, not Pursuing his, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me</p>
			<p class="character">Montague</p>
			<p class="verseline">Many a morning hath he there been seen, </p>
			<p class="verseline">With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs; </p>
			<p class="verseline">But all so soon as the all-cheering sun </p>
			<p class="verseline">Should in the farthest East bean to draw </p>
			<p class="verseline">The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Away from light steals home my heavy son </p>
			<p class="verseline">And private in his chamber pens himself, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight </p>
			<p class="verseline">And makes himself an artificial night</p>
			<p class="verseline">Black and portentous must this humour prove </p>

			<p class="character">Benvolio</p>
			<p class="verseline">My noble uncle, do you know the cause? </p>

			<p class="character">Benvolio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Have you importun’d him by any means? </p>
			<p class="character">Montague</p>
			<p class="verseline">Both by myself and many other friend; </p>
			<p class="verseline">But he, his own affections’ counsellor, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is to himself- I will not say how true- </p>
			<p class="verseline">But to himself so secret and so close, </p>
			<p class="verseline">So far from sounding and discovery, </p>
			<p class="verseline">As is the bud bit with an envious worm </p>
			<p class="verseline">Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air </p>
			<p class="verseline">Or dedicate his beauty to the sun</p>
			<p class="verseline">Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow, </p>

			<p class="verseline">The fish lives in the sea, and ‘tis much pride </p>
			<p class="verseline">For fair without the fair within to hide</p>
			<p class="verseline">That book in many’s eyes doth share the glory, </p>
			<p class="verseline">That in gold clasps locks in the golden story; </p>

			<p class="character">Mercutio</p>
			<p class="verseline">O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you</p>
			<p class="verseline">She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes </p>
			<p class="verseline">In shape no bigger than an agate stone </p>
			<p class="verseline">On the forefinger of an alderman, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Drawn with a team of little atomies </p>
			<p class="verseline">Athwart men’s noses as they lie asleep; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Her wagon spokes made of long spinners’ legs, </p>
			<p class="verseline">The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Her traces, of the smallest spider’s web; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Her collars, of the moonshine’s wat’ry beams; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Her whip, of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Not half so big as a round little worm </p>
			<p class="verseline">Prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers</p>
			<p class="verseline">And in this state she ‘gallops night by night </p>
			<p class="verseline">Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love; </p>
			<p class="verseline">O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on cursies straight; </p>
			<p class="verseline">O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees; </p>
			<p class="verseline">O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are</p>
			<p class="verseline">Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail </p>
			<p class="verseline">Tickling a parson’s nose as ‘a lies asleep, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Then dreams he of another benefice</p>
			<p class="verseline">Sometimes she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon </p>
			<p class="verseline">Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two </p>
			<p class="verseline">And sleeps again. This is that very Mab </p>
			<p class="verseline">That plats the manes of horses in the night </p>
			<p class="verseline">And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Which once untangled much misfortune bodes </p>
			<p class="verseline">This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, </p>
			<p class="verseline">That presses them and learns them first to bear, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Making them women of good carriage</p>
			<p class="verseline">This is she- </p>

			<p class="verseline">True, I talk of dreams; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Which are the children of an idle brain, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Begot of nothing but vain fantasy; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Which is as thin of substance as the air, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes </p>
			<p class="verseline">Even now the frozen bosom of the North </p>
			<p class="verseline">And, being anger’d, puffs away from thence, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Turning his face to the dew-dropping South</p>

			<p class="verseline">With this night’s revels and expire the term </p>

			<p class="character">Mercutio</p>
			<p class="prose">More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he’s the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay</p>

			<p class="prose">Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole</p>

			<p class="character">Romeo</p>

What she bid me say, I will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into a fool’s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing to be off’red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing</p>

			<p class="verseline">O noble Prince. I can discover all </p>
			<p class="verseline">The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl</p>
			<p class="verseline">There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, </p>
			<p class="verseline">That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio</p>
			<p class="character">Capulet</p>
			<p class="verseline">Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother’s child! </p>
			<p class="verseline">O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill’d </p>
			<p class="verseline">Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true, </p>
			<p class="verseline">For blood of ours shed blood of Montague</p>
			<p class="verseline">O cousin, cousin! </p>
			<p class="character">Prince</p>
			<p class="verseline">Benvolio, who began this bloody fray? </p>
			<p class="character">Benvolio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did stay</p>
			<p class="verseline">Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink </p>
			<p class="verseline">How nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal </p>
			<p class="verseline">Your high displeasure. All this- uttered </p>
			<p class="verseline">With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d- </p>
			<p class="verseline">Could not take truce with the unruly spleen </p>
			<p class="verseline">Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts </p>
			<p class="verseline">With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats </p>
			<p class="verseline">Cold death aside and with the other sends </p>
			<p class="verseline">It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity </p>
			<p class="verseline">Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud, </p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Hold, friends! friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue, </p>
			<p class="verseline">His agile arm beats down their fatal points, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And ‘twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm </p>
			<p class="verseline">An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life </p>
			<p class="verseline">Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled; </p>
			<p class="verseline">But by-and-by comes back to Romeo, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Who had but newly entertain’d revenge, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I </p>
			<p class="verseline">Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly</p>
			<p class="verseline">This is the truth, or let Benvolio die</p>
			<p class="character">Capulet</p>
			<p class="verseline">Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Affection makes him false, he speaks not true</p>
			<p class="verseline">Some twenty of them fought in this black strife, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And all those twenty could but kill one life</p>
			<p class="verseline">I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give</p>
			<p class="verseline">Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live</p>
			<p class="character">Prince</p>
			<p class="verseline">Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? </p>
			<p class="character">Montague</p>
			<p class="verseline">Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio’s friend; </p>
			<p class="verseline">His fault concludes but what the law should end, </p>
			<p class="verseline">The life of Tybalt</p>
			<p class="character">Prince</p>
			<p class="verseline">And for that offence </p>
			<p class="verseline">Immediately we do exile him hence</p>
			<p class="verseline">I have an interest in your hate’s proceeding, </p>
			<p class="verseline">My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding; </p>
			<p class="verseline">But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine </p>
			<p class="verseline">That you shall all repent the loss of mine</p>
			<p class="verseline">I will be deaf to pleading and excuses; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses</p>
			<p class="verseline">Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Else, when he is found, that hour is his last</p>
			<p class="verseline">Bear hence this body, and attend our will</p>
			<p class="verseline">Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill</p>

			<p class="character">Prince</p>
			<p class="verseline">Then say it once what thou dost know in this</p>
			<p class="character">Friar</p>
			<p class="verseline">I will be brief, for my short date of breath </p>
			<p class="verseline">Is not so long as is a tedious tale</p>
			<p class="verseline">Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife</p>
			<p class="verseline">I married them; and their stol’n marriage day </p>
			<p class="verseline">Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death </p>
			<p class="verseline">Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city; </p>
			<p class="verseline">For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d</p>
			<p class="verseline">You, to remove that siege of grief from her, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Betroth’d and would have married her perforce </p>
			<p class="verseline">To County Paris. Then comes she to me </p>
			<p class="verseline">And with wild looks bid me devise some mean </p>
			<p class="verseline">To rid her from this second marriage, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Or in my cell there would she kill herself</p>
			<p class="verseline">Then gave I her (so tutored by my art) </p>
			<p class="verseline">A sleeping potion; which so took effect </p>
			<p class="verseline">As I intended, for it wrought on her </p>
			<p class="verseline">The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo </p>
			<p class="verseline">That he should hither come as this dire night </p>
			<p class="verseline">To help to take her from her borrowed grave, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Being the time the potion’s force should cease</p>
			<p class="verseline">But he which bore my letter, Friar John, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Was stay’d by accident, and yesternight </p>
			<p class="verseline">Return’d my letter back. Then all alone </p>
			<p class="verseline">At the prefixed hour of her waking </p>
			<p class="verseline">Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Meaning to keep her closely at my cell </p>
			<p class="verseline">Till I conveniently could send to Romeo</p>
			<p class="verseline">But when I came, some minute ere the time </p>
			<p class="verseline">Of her awaking, here untimely lay </p>
			<p class="verseline">The noble Paris and true Romeo dead</p>
			<p class="verseline">She wakes; and I entreated her come forth </p>
			<p class="verseline">And bear this work of heaven with patience; </p>
			<p class="verseline">But then a noise did scare me from the tomb, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And she, too desperate, would not go with me, </p>
			<p class="verseline">But, as it seems, did violence on herself</p>
			<p class="verseline">All this I know, and to the marriage </p>
			<p class="verseline">Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this </p>
			<p class="verseline">Miscarried by my fault, let my old life </p>
			<p class="verseline">Be sacrific’d, some hour before his time, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Unto the rigour of severest law</p>
			<p class="character">Prince</p>
			<p class="verseline">We still have known thee for a holy man</p>
			<p class="verseline">Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say in this? </p>
			<p class="character">Balthasar</p>
			<p class="verseline">I brought my master news of Juliet’s death; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And then in post he came from Mantua </p>
			<p class="verseline">To this same place, to this same monument</p>
			<p class="verseline">This letter he early bid me give his father, </p>
			<p class="verseline">And threat’ned me with death, going in the vault, </p>
			<p class="verseline">If I departed not and left him there</p>
			<p class="character">Prince</p>
			<p class="verseline">Give me the letter. I will look on it</p>
			<p class="verseline">Where is the County’s page that rais’d the watch? </p>
			<p class="verseline">Sirrah, what made your master in this place? </p>
			<p class="character">Boy</p>
			<p class="verseline">He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And bid me stand aloof, and so I did</p>
			<p class="verseline">Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And by-and-by my master drew on him; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And then I ran away to call the watch</p>
			<p class="character">Prince</p>
			<p class="verseline">This letter doth make good the friar’s words, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Their course of love, the tidings of her death; </p>
			<p class="verseline">And here he writes that he did buy a poison </p>
			<p class="verseline">Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal </p>
			<p class="verseline">Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet</p>
			<p class="verseline">Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage, </p>
			<p class="verseline">See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, </p>
			<p class="verseline">That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love! </p>
			<p class="verseline">And I, for winking at you, discords too, </p>
			<p class="verseline">Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d</p>
			<p class="character">Capulet</p>
			<p class="verseline">O brother Montague, give me thy hand</p>
			<p class="verseline">This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more </p>
			<p class="verseline">Can I demand</p>
			<p class="character">Montague</p>
			<p class="verseline">But I can give thee more; </p>
			<p class="verseline">For I will raise her Statue in pure gold, </p>
			<p class="verseline">That whiles Verona by that name is known, </p>
			<p class="verseline">There shall no figure at such rate be set </p>
			<p class="verseline">As that of true and faithful Juliet</p>
			<p class="character">Capulet</p>
			<p class="verseline">As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie- </p>
			<p class="verseline">Poor sacrifices of our enmity! </p>
			<p class="character">Prince</p>
			<p class="verseline">A glooming peace this morning with it brings</p>
			<p class="verseline">The sun for sorrow will not show his head</p>
			<p class="verseline">Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things; </p>
			<p class="verseline">Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished; </p>
			<p class="verseline">For never was a story of more woe </p>
			<p class="verseline">Than this of Juliet and her Romeo</p>
			<p class="verseline"><span class="stage_directions_inline">Exeunt</span> omnes</p>
